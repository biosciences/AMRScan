Description: 
    AMRScan is a hybrid open-source toolkit implemented in both R and Nextflow 
    to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. 
    The R script (AMRScan_standalone.R) provides a lightweight, single-sample solution suitable for local or rapid analysis, 
    while the Nextflow workflow (main.nf) enables scalable, reproducible AMR gene detection in high-throughput or HPC/cloud environments. 
    Both implementations use BLAST alignment against reference AMR gene databases (e.g., CARD), 
    and include support for quality control, FASTQ-to-FASTA conversion, and result parsing.
